The **Deans Trophy** is the most prestigious and oldest sports award among Fiji Secondary Schools sporting competitions. Established in 1939, it is the oldest tournament in the Fiji Rugby Union and has a rich history of excellence in secondary school rugby.

## A Storied Tradition

The original Deans Trophy is named after Mr. S. S. Dean, the Manager of the MƒÅori All Blacks team that toured Fiji in 1938. Mr. Dean donated the silver-coloured metal rugby ball as the prestigious prize for senior teams in the boys' secondary schools rugby competition. Today, this historic trophy is preserved at the Fiji Museum in Suva.

The inaugural Deans Trophy competition was held in 1939, and Queen Victoria School (QVS) emerged as the first winners. QVS has since become a dominant force in the competition, securing the U19 or U18 title a record 24 times.
