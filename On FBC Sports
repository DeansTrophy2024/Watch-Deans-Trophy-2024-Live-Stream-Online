The Deans Trophy is the most prestigious and oldest sports award among Fiji Secondary Schools sporting competitions. The boys rugby union annual competition was first introduced in 1939 and is the oldest tournament in the Fiji Rugby Union.

The original Deans Trophy is named after Mr S. S. Dean, the Manager of the Māori All Blacks team that toured Fiji in 1938 who donated the silver-coloured metal rugby ball as the prestigious prize for senior teams in the boys secondary schools rugby competition. It is now kept at the Fiji Museum in Suva.

The trophy was first won by Queen Victoria School (QVS) at the first Deans Trophy competition in 1939. QVS has gone on to win the prestigious U19 or U18 title a record 24 times.
